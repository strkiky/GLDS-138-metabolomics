# GLDS-138-metabolomics
An exploratory data analysis of two bacteria, in spaceflight and on ground.

I've separated Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus into two separate files:

The main analysis, B. subtilis is in GLDS-138 metabolomics.Rmd.

S. aureus, GLDS-138 metabolomics S. aureus.rmd is as stated.
The S. aureus study is simpler, and may be better to take a look over there first.
